# Traffic-analysis
Traffic analysis and modeling based on video data

This repository contains traffic detection and tracking scripts focused on highway traffic.
The detection uses ready-made models trained on the COCO 2017 collection downloaded from Tensorflow Hub
For tracking, a simple algorithm based on centroids and shortest distance is used
A mapping of real coordinates to pixel coordinates is used for speed estimation.

Scheme of operation of the program:
